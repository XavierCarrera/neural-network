<h2> About this project: </h2>

This repository is my project for the [Neural Networks with Keras and Scikit-Learn Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/keras-neural-networks/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description : </h2>

In this repository we build neural networks with Keras and Scikit Learn, in order to apply key concepts from deep learning. Some of the topics covered include:

- Neural Network Structures
- Activation Functions
- Loss Functions
- Optimizers
- Regularization
- Binary Classification
- Performance metrics
